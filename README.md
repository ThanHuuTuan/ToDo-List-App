# ToDo App
In an attempt to learn more about the use of strict key/value store, I started creating Todo task items in the Redis CLI. 
After a few hours of building different representations of task items, I decided to build out a full API in Flask. 

This project uses the Google OAuth2 API to allow single sign-on, and stores the user's numerical Google ID in the 
Redis datastore. That number is then used in the Redis key to access particular users' task items. Task items are 
stored in a Redis hash. For example, a Redis key may look like this: 
`Todos:users:<user_id>:tasks:<task_id>`

Task ids are generated by hashing the 'Title' of a task object into a reversible 20 digit number. This was 
accomplished using Python's built-in hashlib library. 
I traded space for speed by creating multiple Redis sets for different query parameters. For example, 
when querying certain tasks, this hash returns a list of : 
`Todos:users:<user_id>:tasks:<category>:<task_id>`

To search by date, I converted datetime objects in Python into numerical representations and stored task_ids in a 
sorted set in Redis. To access the tasks, one first queries the datastore for the task_ids for a particular date 
range, then queries for the fields of each particular task using the task_id as a key.
